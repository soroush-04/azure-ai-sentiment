### AI-based Proof-of-Concept Coordination

To address negative user feedback and improve our AI sytems productivity, we need to identify the root causes. The performance of the AI system can be broken down into five main areas:

1. **Accuracy**: Check if the AI system provides correct and reliable information.
2. **Verbosity**: Evaluate if the response is too short or too long, and if it affects understanding.
3. **Hallucination**: Look for instances where the AI generates hallucinations or made-up information.
4. **Adherence to Instructions**: Ensure the AI follows the instructions given in the prompt and stays on task.
5. **Writing Quality**: Review the grammar, clarity, and structure of the response. Also, check if the AI uses inappropriate, aggressive, or absuive language or phrases.

Once we have a better understanding of the root causes, we can implement more reliable approaches to improve the AI system. Based on the issues identified in each key area, we can focus on specific enhancements:

- **Prompt Engineering**: If issues are found in areas like accuracy, hallucination, or instruction following, we may need to refine the prompts to guide the AI better.
- **Database Quality**: If the problem lies in accuracy or hallucination, improving the quality and diversity of the available dataset can provide more reliable information.
- **Model Training**: If issues are found with instruction tracking or writing quality, we can focus on fine-tuning the model with specific training data to address those weaknesses.
